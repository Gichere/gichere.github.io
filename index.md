### Research and Data Analysis 

DETERMINING THE MEAN DIFFERENCES IN STUDENTS’ PERFORMANCE BASED
ON TYPE OF ACCOMMODATION- International Journal of Education and Research (ijern) Vol. 7 No. 1 January 2019
  <br><br>
This study investigated academic performance with respect to type of accommodation in the Kenyan
Universities, case study of the Technical University of Mombasa. Sample of 380 students were
selected from Technical University of Mombasa. Out of the sample 165 were living within the
university premises while 215 were staying outside the university premises. Stratified sampling and
simple random sampling was used to pick the students. Z test was used to test the hypothesis that
the mean performance of the students based on residence does not differ significantly. 
Results show that off-campus group had a higher mean in performance (M = 56, SD = 6.211) compared to
their counterparts (M = 53, SD = 5.55). A density plot showed that the two types of accommodation
overlap largely in terms of probability density function. Further results showed that the mean
difference was statistically significant at 5% level of significance (z = 2.0591, p-value = 0.03948).
Therefore, it can be concluded that there are significant differences in mean academic performance
based on type of residence. The off-campus seemed to be performing better than the on-campus
group. Therefore, type of accommodation affects student’s performance in Public Universities.)
